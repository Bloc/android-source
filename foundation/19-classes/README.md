## Classes

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (`foundation/19-classes`). Edit `Dog.java` and fill in the portions where specified by comments. You're going to be writing _setters_ and _getters_.

After you've finished, compile your Java code by running the following command:

```bash
$ javac -d bin src/com/bloc/classes/*.java
```

Correct compilation errors as they are a result of modifications made by you.
After it returns successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

```bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

```bash
$ java com.bloc.classes.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, you've implemented the methods properly.
